<h3><b>Analysis tools for characterizing tissue surfaces of any shape</b></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
How are cells aligned on tissue surfaces? Does the alignment depend on local curvature? 
Where are regions of misalignment? Do these regions correlate spatially with the fluorescence signal 
of the molecular marker of interest? And how do all these properties change over time? 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img align="left" width="250" style="margin:0px 20px 0px 0px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Julia-Eckert/Julia-Eckert.github.io/refs/heads/main/uploads/NatCommsSpheroid.png" />
These are challenging questions that are not easy to answer, as we are capturing two-dimensional 
images of three-dimensional (3D) tissues. The main difficulty lies in accurately stitching together 
individual images from a z-stack and reconstructing 3D information, independent of the shape and structure 
of the multicellular system. We took on this challenge and developed an image analysis pipeline to 
fully capture tissue properties such as the nematic order, topological defects, local curvature, 
and fluorescence signals from molecular markers across the entire surface of 3D tissues.

Capturing these 3D properties enables us, e.g., to verify theoretical predictions from simulations 
by investigating the nematic orientation field of surface cells in multicellular aggregates, as well as
to link biological mechanisms with physical descriptions in zebrafish heart systems. These image analysis 
tools now make it possible to quantitatively analyze tissue surfaces and help us address the questions outlined above.
