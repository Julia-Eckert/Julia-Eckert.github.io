	Hello! 
	I am Julia, an experimental biophysicist and enthusiastic image analyst dedicated to understanding the mechanisms 
	of morphogenesis using concepts from soft matter physics. Currently, I am a DFG Walter Benjamin Fellow, hosted in Alpha Yap's Lab 
	at The University of Queensland in Australia.
